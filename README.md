## Hero's Power Contract

I, *Willem van Heemstra*, am fearlessly examining the ways in which I can call forth my inner hero.

I now make a sacred pact to accept myself as **[a powerful creator of my life](./100/README.md)** and to move toward and live out my next **[wildest dream](./200/README.md)**.

I understand that growth requires moving through new, possibly uncomforatble things.

I get that I may have to expand my boundaries.

I am willing to tap into my courage.

I acknowledge I am doing this for my greater good.

I reserve the right to expand this contract and give myself permission to grow through each step in bringing on my inner hero.

Signed,

*Willem van Heemstra*
